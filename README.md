# learnJava

The goal of this repository is to increase my knowledge of java. This is worked out in two ways:

1. **Learn by doing.** By writing the code in this repo I hope to increase muscle memory and get exposure to all corners of the language.
2. **Knowledge store.** By storing this code in a public repo, I will created a readily available reference guide for myself and others.

At the outset, the content of this repository is largely indebted to:

* [Oracle Java SE Documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/)
